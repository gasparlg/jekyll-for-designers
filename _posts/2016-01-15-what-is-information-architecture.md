# Finding is the new doing

Information Architecture has a fancy name and to many is a new and growing task in big organizations which work with a gazillion pieces of content like Google, Facebook, or Amazon.
But in reality the architecture of information is as old as information itself. It has always been part along with questions like “How do we structure this set of data so is easily found by others?”.

The index of a book is information architecture. Organizing books in a library by alphabetical order or by subject is information architecture. Imagine if 500 years ago the europeans that first arrived in the American continent, instead of making maps and using cartography, they had written directions and locations only using written words. It would have been terribly difficult if not impossible for others to arrive to the Americas. This example shows that Maps are another example of information architecture, which is structuring information so a person (or computer) can easily find what they are looking for.

In other words Information Architecture is the structure on how content is organized and presented to a user. Or as the Information Architecture Institute explains: “Information architecture is about helping people understand their surroundings and find what they’re looking for, in the real world as well as online.”

In the modern digital world Information Architecture is present in anything that contains information like websites, applications, softwares, intranets, etc. But who does it? Is there Information Architects out there? Information Architecture has rarely been a job title, though this has been changing in the last years with the appearance and growth of big web based information providers such as web browsers, social media companies, ecommerce platforms, online banks, and many other organizations.

But even though Information Architecture is fairly new as a job title, the task it is not, and has been shared by designers, developers, marketers, and anybody who has participated in the development of an information interface. People who call themselves Information Architects will have experience in all or some of following areas: design, marketing, content strategy, user experience, user interface, analytics, search optimization, business research, and other related tasks.

Information Architecture uses research as its main tool and this can take the form of competitor analysis, reading academic papers on human/computer interaction, testing ideas on real users, analyzing existing industry and design standards, etc.

As an example, Martin Belam of the British newspaper “The Guardian” tells that they invited to their office some of the newspaper readers to try their new iPhone app. They filmed them to test whether they understood and made use of the functionality of the app that the newsgroup was developing. 

Information Architecture at a micro level can mean studying the categories to search a product on a eccomerce site. Or in a larger scale could be changing the general position of information in a site in accordance on how the target users are expected to find it. And in a strategic level might be deciding the brand experience that the user should have.

Information Architecture plays a major role on the delivering of content. If information cannot be found, that information is worthless. Information architecture help users and organizations in making information easily findable and accessible. 

Every service and product provided is based on information, and as every second there is more and more information created, finding the correct piece of content is becoming a harder task. The organizations that understand this the better are the ones that are going to adapt to the multi-connected and ultra-informed world that we are living in today.
